            <h2>My Trip to Jamacia!</h2><br>

            <p>I went to Jamicia for my 35th Birthday and had a great time. The country was beautiful and the food was good. It was also my first time taking a solo trip which was exciting!I plan to travel to more exotic places and see more of the world!</p><br>

            <h2>My Trip to the Bahamas!</h2><br>

            <p>I got the chance to go on a cruise &amp; to the Bahamas for my 30th bday! My first time out of the country and my first time on a cruise. It was nice and beautiful but i would of liked to spend more time to see the city since the cruise only stopped there for one night. One thing for sure is that they drive fast over there in the foreign countries when there roads are not as secure as ours. </p><br>

I want to try the African food, learn about the culture and their way of living! We hear so many things about Africa and I just want to see it and experience it for myself! </p><br>
